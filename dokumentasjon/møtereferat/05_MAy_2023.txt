Meeting notes 05.03
Steady progress on movement controls
Hit a snag on BLE proximinity. Expo Go framework does not support bluetooth functionality.
Consdering other options, geolocation is possible.
Discussed previous options for proximity technology.
	- Signal triangulation with WLAN routers (too inaccurate, not enough time)
	- Warehouse map (unable to retrieve current robot location as xy coordinates, need it to implement this option as well as other functionalities)
